# Optimization_location_of_store_house

I'm excited to share my latest project: Optimization of Storehouse Location in Asia(specific).
I have developed a website where you can input the coordinates of your clients in the shown map and provide the no. of needed storehouse, and it will provide you with the optimized location for the storehouses.

Key Highlights:
👉 Utilized the concept of Linear Programming for optimization.
👉 Leveraged Python libraries such as Sci-Kit Learn, Numpy, etc.
👉 Used Manhattan distance to calculate the distance between clients and the warehouse.
👉 Implemented KMeans for clustering.
